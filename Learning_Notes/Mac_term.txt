Notes on Commands and their usage
	MacOS is different from linux because they have different kernels
	(mac uses darwin kernel built on FreeBSD and linux uses linux kernel)


	curl
		-make URL request
		-ex:
			curl http://localhost:8080
			curl https://www.google.com
			curl -X POST http://example.com


	ifconfig

		-Ex output:
			eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
				inet 192.168.1.20  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
				inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe4e:66a1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
				ether 08:00:27:4e:66:a1  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
				RX packets 1456  bytes 151234 (151.2 KB)
				TX packets 1302  bytes 123456 (123.4 KB)

		-Meaning:
			-eth0 or emp0s3 = ethernet, lo = localhost, wlan0 or wlp2s0 = wifi, docker0 or br0 = virtual interfaces

			-flags: 
				UP/DOWN -> interface is enabled/disabled
				RUNNING -> HW of interfaceis active
				BROADCAST/MULTICAST -> supports broadcast/multicast 
				PROMISC -> interface captures all packages
			
		

	netstat (MacOs- only) same as 'ip route' on linux
		-


	ipconfig
		-view and change IP configs
			-
