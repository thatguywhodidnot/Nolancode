General questions and topics to study/know for a dream software position



OpenGL and directx

raytracing/raytracers
    -program that renders graphics by sending rays from every pixel
    -does intersection and physics light calculations to color each pixel you see

software resterizers
    -renders through algorithm that covers pixel on screen with triangles and then figure out how light will effect each pixel within each triangle
    -software resterizations means the CPU is being used
    -most modern GPUs use rastorization algorithm


Graphics (CPP)

    -what are templates
    -what does 'inline' mean
    -what are big and little endian
    -what is a virtual function, how much overhead does it use 
    -what are virtual destructors
    -heap vs stack memory
    -what is namespace/namesppace usage(
        -prevents name conflicts
        -creates spaces, if two things(function, variable) have the same name but are in different namespaces it will be ok
        -use '::' this is a scope resoultion operator
        -Example:
            
            #include <iostream>

            namespace one{ int x =1; };
            namespace two{ int x =4;};

            int main(){ 
                std::cout<< one::x;  //prints '1'
                //or
                using namespace one; std::cout<< x; //also prints '1'
                return 0;
            };

        -if you use 'using namespace std::cout' you can the write only cout instead of std::cout
        )



Dlang( the d language)


YAML(stands for 'yaml aint markup language)
    -used for config files
    -similar to json( you can write json syntax in YAML)
