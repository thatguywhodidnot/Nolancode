general notes for cpp based off of c knowledge


important basics

    -iostream -> new print, can do things like:
        //text centering
        //prints 'pad' amount of the character 'fill' around str
        std::cout
            << std::string(pad, fill) 
            << " " << str << " "
            << std::string(totalfill-pad, fill)
            << "\n";

    -Classes -> blueprint for an object, part of OOP
        -contains attributes like a color
        -contains functions like an action

        -Ex:
            class Dog{
                //public attributes -> meaning they can be accessed form outside of class

                public:
                    std::string breed;
                    int age;

                //Constructors -> member functions that are auto called when and object of a class is made
                //will have the same name as class
                
                Dog(std::string b, int a){
                    age = a;
                    breed =b;

                }

    
            };
