general notes for cpp based off of c knowledge


important basics

    -iostream -> new print, can do things like:
        //text centering
        //prints 'pad' amount of the character 'fill' around str
        std::cout
            << std::string(pad, fill) 
            << " " << str << " "
            << std::string(totalfill-pad, fill)
            << "\n";
        -to avoid using std every time do:
            using namespace std;
            cout<< hello;

    -Classes -> blueprint for an object, part of OOP
        -contains attributes like a color
        -contains functions like an action
        -Constructors -> function in the class with same name as class that will be called automaticly when class obj is made

        -Ex:
            class Dog{
                //public attributes -> meaning they can be accessed form outside of class

                public:
                    std::string breed;
                    int age;

                //Constructors -> member functions that are auto called when and object of a class is made
                //will have the same name as class
                
                Dog(std::string b, int a){
                    age = a;
                    breed =b;

                }

    
            };
            -inheritance ->derived class onherits features of a base class
            Ex:
                class client{
                    int cash;
                    public:
                        void have_money(){
                            std::cout<< cash  << std::endl;
                        };
                };

                class old_client : public client{
                    int years;
                    void how_long(){
                        std::cout << years << std::endl;
                    };
                };

    -Big and little endian
        -two ways of storing bytes of data in memory, when an object is made up of multiple memory bytes the lowest memory byte contains all the other address of the object
            -ex: word is stored in 0x2000, 0x2001, 0x2002 -> ox2000 stores 0x2001 and 0x2002

        -big endian -> most significant bytes are at lowets memory address
            -
        -little endian -> stores the least signicicant bytes at lowest memory points
            -
    -Stacks and Heap
        -Stacks
            -system does automaticly, stores a functions local variables on stack and then frees them at the end of function excecution
            -temporary memory, limited space(can be overflown)
        -Heap

    -Excemptions 
        -noexcempt
